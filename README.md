# FIU Stadium

FIU Stadium is a proof of concept VR game that explores the capabilities of the volumetric captures created by Florida International University's ISTAR (Immersive Studio for Altered Reality) volumetric studio. Through this game, we explore the potential of 3D scanning technology and it's implementation in not only Unity, but in virtual reality. The assets in this project were all created using the technologies available through ISTAR, such as our state-of-the-art hand scanner and our 21 depth-sensing camera studio.

The 3D assets created using the ISTAR studio include the model of Roary, FIU's mascot model, and the model of Dean Brian Schriner. These assets are available by visiting https://volumetric.fiu.edu/

This game also includes a mini-game, where the objective is to tackle Roary before he catches the ball and reaches the end zone. But be careful! There are multiple Roary masots on the field, and the Roary that Dean Schriner throws to will be different each time! Watch the ball in the air carefully, and try your best to figure out which Roary the dean throws the ball to!
