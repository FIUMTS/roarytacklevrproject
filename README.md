# Roary Tackle
Roary Tackle is a small game made for testing the capabilities and potential of Florida International University's ISTAR (Immersive Studio for Altered Reality) volumetric studio. The 3D assets used in this project were all created using 3D capture technology provided by the ISTAR studio, including the model of Roary, FIU's mascot model, and the model of Dean Brian Schriner. These assets are available by visiting https://volumetric.fiu.edu/

The objective in this game is to tackle Roary before he catches the ball that Dean Schriner throws. But be careful! There are multiple Roary masots on the field, and the Roary that Dean Schriner throws to will be different each time! Watch the ball in the air carefully, and try your best to figure out which Roary the dean throws the ball to!

Through this game, we explored the potential of 3D scanning technology and it's implementation in not only Unity, but in virtual reality.
